 Objective:

The objective of this project is to create a simple login authentication system using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The system allows users to register, log in, reset their password, and access a secured page, helping to understand the basic working of authentication.

This project was built mainly for learning authentication logic and client-side validation.

Tools & Technologies Used:

HTML – For creating different pages (Register, Login, Forgot Password, Dashboard)

CSS – For styling the UI with a modern black and blue theme

JavaScript – For handling authentication logic and validations

LocalStorage – To store user data and login state

VS Code – Code editor

Web Browser – For testing the application

 Steps Performed:

Created separate pages for registration, login, password reset, and dashboard

Implemented user registration and stored credentials using localStorage

Added login functionality with credential validation

Implemented a forgot password feature to reset the user’s password

Secured the dashboard page by checking login status

Added logout functionality to end the session

Designed a modern dark UI with smooth transitions and animations

 Features:

User registration

User login validation

Forgot password & reset password functionality

Protected dashboard (secured page)

Logout functionality

Modern dark theme with smooth transitions

Simple and easy-to-understand flow

 Outcome:

The result is a fully working client-side authentication system that demonstrates how login and session handling works at a basic level.
This project improved my understanding of JavaScript logic, localStorage usage, authentication flow, and UI design.
